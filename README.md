## [Concrete CMS Bedrock Documentation](https://documentation.concretecms.org/developers/appendix/concrete-cms-bedrock-foundation-concrete-and-concrete-themes)

## Description

Using documentation from link above, I wanted to have a package ready to use for quick theme building for [Concrete CMS](https://www.concretecms.com/). Please feel free to add suggestions or pull requests.  

This package will automatically install the thumbnails for Bootstrap5 so there is no manual setup of these needed in the Dashboard.

JS and CSS are setup as assets in the package controller and required in the page_theme.php.

## Installation

1. **Automatic Install with Shell Script**
   
   If using a Unix platform such as Linux or Mac OS, use your terminal and navigate to the public folder for Concrete CMS.  This folder contains the following: **application, concrete, packages, updates, index.php**.  Then run the following commands:  
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/davedew/afixia-theme-basic-bedrock.git
    
    cd afixia-theme-basic-bedrock
    
    ./install.sh
    ```
    Everything should be moved to their correct places and the repository directory should be removed now.
    You should be able to install the package/theme and go to your **basic_bedrock_build** folder and run **npm install** then **npm run prod**.
2. **Powershell Installation**
   
   If using Windows, open Powershell and navigate to the public folder for Concrete CMS.  This folder contains the following: **application, concrete, packages, updates, index.php**.  Then run the following commands:  
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/davedew/afixia-theme-basic-bedrock.git
    
    cd afixia-theme-basic-bedrock
    
    Move-Item basic_bedrock_build ../

    Move-Item packages/theme_basic_bedrock ../packages

    cd ..

    Remove-Item -LiteralPath "afixia-theme-basic-bedrock" -Force -Recurse
    ```
    Everything should be moved to their correct places and the repository directory should be removed now.

    git clone https://github.com/davedew/afixia-theme-basic-bedrock.git
    
    cd afixia-theme-basic-bedrock
    
    move basic_bedrock_build ../

    move packages/theme_basic_bedrock ../packages

    cd ..

    @RD /S /Q "afixia-theme-basic-bedrock"
    ```
    Everything should be moved to their correct places and the repository directory should be removed now.

4. **Manual Install**
   1. git clone https://github.com/davedew/afixia-theme-basic-bedrock.git where ever you want to temporarily download these files
   2. Move the **basic_bedrock_build** folder to the root / public folder of your Concrete CMS site.  It should be on the same level as your application, concrete, and packages folder.
   3. Move the **theme_basic_bedrock** within the packages folder to your Concrete CMS packages folder.
   4. Done, you should be able to install the package / theme and go to your **basic_bedrock_build** folder and run **npm install** then **npm run prod**.

## Personalize for your project

- Change the icon.png (97px x 97px) in the packages/theme_basic_bedrock directory.
- Change the thumbnail.png (360px x 270px) in the packages/theme_basic_bedrock/themes/basic_bedrock directory.
- To change the name and descriptions, for my example below I want my theme to be named "**Rock Solid**":
  -  **Directory names**
     - packages/theme_rock_solid
     - packages/theme_rock_solid/theme/rock_solid
   - **Namespaces**
     - **File:** packages/theme_rock_solid/controller.php
       - namespace Concrete\Package\ThemeRockSolid;
     - **File:** packages/theme_rock_solid/theme/rock_solid/page_theme.php
       - namespace Concrete\Package\ThemeRockSolid\Theme\RockSolid;
   - **Names and Descriptions**
     - **File:** packages/theme_rock_solid/controller.php
       - protected $pkgHandle = 'theme_rock_solid';
       - protected $themePath = 'themes/rock_solid/';
       - protected $themeName = 'Rock Solid';
       - protected $themeHandle = 'rock_solid';
       - public function getPackageDescription: 
       - public function on_start(): Names of assets
     - **File:** packages/theme_rock_solid/theme/rock_solid/page_theme.php
       - public function getThemeName()
       - public function getThemeDescription()
       - $this->requireAsset('basic-bedrock-app');
     - **File:** packages/theme_rock_solid/theme/rock_solid/description.txt
     - **File:** basic_bedrock_build/webpack.mix.js
       - mix.js('src/js/app.js', 'js').setPublicPath('../packages/theme_rock_solid/themes/rock_solid/');
       - mix.sass('src/scss/app.scss', 'css').setPublicPath('../packages/theme_rock_solid/themes/rock_solid/');

## Use / Editing JS and CSS

When making changes to the JavaScript or CSS, make your changes in the basic_bedrock_build/src folder then rebuild the js and css files in the package with **npm run dev** or **npm run prod** for minified versions. 

---

## Node / NPM / Laravel Mix Build CSS / JavaScript

Make sure to install your node modules to start in the [basic_bedrock_build](basic_bedrock_build/) directory:

```
npm install
```

If you do not have npm, you'll need to install [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In [basic_bedrock_build](basic_bedrock_build/) you will see the Laravel Mix setup.  You should be able to use the following documentation from [laravel-mix/docs/cli.md](https://github.com/laravel-mix/laravel-mix/blob/master/docs/cli.md).

**Note:** The package.json was created from my environment.  You might want to start over from your own.  You can do so with the following:

Remove the **package.json**, **package-lock.json** (if exists), and the **node_modules** (if exists) folder and start over with the following:

I'm referencing Laravel Mix's docs here: [https://github.com/laravel-mix/laravel-mix/blob/master/docs/installation.md](https://github.com/laravel-mix/laravel-mix/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

In the **basic_bedrock_build** folder do the following:

1. npm init -y
2. npm install laravel-mix --save-dev
3. npm install @concretecms/bedrock
4. Leave the webpack.mix.js and all other files alone, then run 
5. npx run prod

---

## Setup npm run watch:

If you want to develop fast with [Browser Sync](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/browsersync) you'll need to update the webpack.mix.js file.  You'll find that I have added the following in there:

```javascript
mix.browserSync({
    proxy: 'c591.test' // You need to change this to your local dev URL for npm run watch or npm run watch
});
```
Make sure you change the proxy url to your local development url.

---

## CLI Commands:

To build assets for development, reach for the `npm run dev` command. Mix will then read your `webpack.mix.js` configuration file, and compile your assets.

```
npm run dev
```

#### Watch Assets for Changes

Particularly for larger projects, compilation can take a bit of time. For this reason, it's highly recommended that you instead leverage webpack's ability to watch your filesystem for changes. The `npx mix watch` command will handle this for you. Now, each time you update a file, Mix will automatically recompile the file and rebuild your bundle. 

```
npm run watch
```

#### Polling

In certain situations, webpack may not automatically detect changes. An example of this is when you're on an NFS volume inside virtualbox. If this is a problem, pass the `--watch-options-poll` option directly to webpack-cli to turn on manual polling. 
 
 ```
npm run watch -- --watch-options-poll=1000
```

Of course, you can add this to a build script within your `package.json` file.

#### Hot Module Replacement

Hot module replacement is a webpack featured that gives supporting modules the ability to "live update" in certain situations. A live-update is when your application refreshes without requiring a page reload. In fact, this is what powers Vue's live updates when developing. To turn this feature on, include the `--hot` flag. 

```
npm run hot
```

### Compiling for Production

When it comes time to build your assets for a production environment, Mix will set the appropriate webpack options, minify your source code, and optionally version your assets based on your Mix configuration file (`webpack.mix.js`). To build assets for production, include the `--production` flag - or the alias `-p` - to the Mix CLI. Mix will take care of the rest!

```
npm run prod
```
